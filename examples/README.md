# Examples for WS2818 RGB LED SPI Driver

Make sure to check out [main README.md](../README.md) first.
Here are a few basic examples! Make sure to run them with SPI enabled on 
your device (Raspberry Pi) and the MOSI-pin beeing connected to DIN-port.

## How to run them?
1) Setup Rust + Cargo ;)
2) `cargo run --bin moving_pixel` 
   or `cargo run --bin strobo_disco_light_effect`
